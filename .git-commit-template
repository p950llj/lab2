# The Pipeline expects commit messages in the format:
#
#    <tag>(<jira-ticket>): <message>
#
# Example:
#    fix(CORES-000): Fix bugs in function XYZ
#
# |<---- Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters ---->|

# ---- COMMIT END ----
# <tag> can be:
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    build    ()
#    chore    ()
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    perf     ()
#    refactor (refactoring code)
#    revert   (reverting to a previous state)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    ci       ()
#
# --------------------
# <jira-ticket> can be:
#
#    <Group id>-<Ticket number>
#
#    If the jira ticket is a correct ticket, Bitbucket will connect the commit to the jira task.
#
# --------------------
# <message> can be:
#
#    Any message explaining the reason for the commit.
#    If the message begins with "BREAKING CHANGE:" it will signal to the pipeline to increase the major version of the app.
# Example:
#    feat(CORES-000): BREAKING CHANGE: Remove function XYZ
#
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
