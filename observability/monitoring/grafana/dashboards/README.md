# How to manage my grafana dashboards

This is a directory that can contain as many dashboards as you require.  the following directory structure applies:
````
--observability
    --monitoring
        --grafana
            --dashboards
                --folder 
                    dashboard1.json
                    dashboard2.json
                    etc.
````
The folder as stated above will be mapped to a Grafana folder. For example your team name or your 
group name can be the folder you want to have your dashboards in.

To begin with, the dashboards will be added to General folder, later on you can rename the general folder to map your team name
